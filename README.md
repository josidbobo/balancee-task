Built it using the Clean Architecture structure for Flutter, the `Rewards Summary Screen` can be located in   
    
    lib/
      features/
        rewards_summary

The `Rewards Summary Screen` is divided into the `Earning Overview`, `CashBackHistory` and `CashoutOptions`

1. `Earning Overview` Gives the customer a chart showing his recent earnings from CashBack in visual format and also displays it in numbers - Total Cashback and Current balance.

2. `CashBack History` Displays each cash back with the booking that generated it as well as the date and amount

3. `Cashout Options` Consists of buttons that tell the user to either withdraw using the bank option or Promo code for future use.
